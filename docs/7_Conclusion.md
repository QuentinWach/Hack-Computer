## Future Ideas
Since there are so many other people who have already done quite similar projects, I do not plan to continue much further here. Still, general topics for future work may include:
### Software
+ Virtual Machine
+ High-Level Language
+ Compiler
+ Operating System
+ Running Doom?
### Hardware
+ .gds Layout
+ TinyTapeout
+ FPGA tests
+ High resolution graphics to emulate a really cool retro game
  + Flappy Bird!
  + Fluid Simulation?
