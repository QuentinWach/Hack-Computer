# The Hack Computer Architecture
_"Hack is a general-purpose computer system, designed to strike a balance between simplicity and power. On the one hand, the Hack architecture can be built in just a few hours of work, [...] at the same time, Hack is sufficiently general to illustrate the key operating principles and hardware elements underlying the design of any digital computer."_

## Getting Started
To get started, a few tools are useful. I use
+ [Verilator](https://github.com/verilator/verilator) for simulation.
+ [GTKWave](https://gtkwave.github.io/gtkwave/install/win.html) for waveform viewing.

Optionally, [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) can be a nice playground to test circuit ideas fast. Instead of Verilator, you may want to use [Icarus Verilog](https://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog?tab=readme-ov-file#table-of-contents) for simulation.
