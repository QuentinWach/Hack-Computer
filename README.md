>[!Attention]
>I am currently restructuring the entire project to be more of an open notebook and to not just be about the Hack computer but a collection of notes about computer engineering, organization, and architecture with enough depth to take any application and design a dedicated computer just for it.


+ Introduces **common tools in the industry** like [Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog) and [GtkWave](https://gtkwave.github.io/gtkwave/install/win.html)
+ Creating and testing the [Hack computer]().
+ Explains important circuits of the architecture with the help of [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).
+ Discusses [Hack assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) and how to convert it to binary code using [Python](https://www.python.org).
+ [ ] Program the game of _Pong_ and emulate the computer to play it.
+ [ ] Create an actual `.gds` mask with the [OpenLane PDK](https://openlane2.readthesrc.io/en/latest/getting_started/newcomers/index.html) and see it in [KLayout](https://www.klayout.de/).
+ [ ] Visualize/render the 3D-chip using [IC3D](https://github.com/QuentinWach/IC3D).
+ [ ] Compile the netlist and render the circuits

I documented every step of the process in the chapters below.

1. [Overview](https://www.quentinwach.com/Hack-Computer/0_Overview.html). This is where you are right now.
2. [Get Started](https://www.quentinwach.com/Hack-Computer/1_Get_Started.html). Explains what we are going to do and guides you through the setup of all the tools. We'll end by writing a "Hello World!" of Verilog and simulating/testing it.
3. [Boolean Arithmetic](https://www.quentinwach.com/Hack-Computer/2_Boolean_Arithmetic.html). Here, we'll create our first arithmetic modules, starting with a Half-Adder and ending with a complete, working Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
4. [Sequential Logic](https://www.quentinwach.com/Hack-Computer/3_Sequential_Logic.html). This chapter contains the code and notes for building registers for memory as well as a counter.
5. [Machine Language](https://www.quentinwach.com/Hack-Computer/4_Machine_Language.html). This is where we'll write our first little program making use of the components we defined up to this point.
6. [Computer Architecture](https://www.quentinwach.com/Hack-Computer/5_Computer_Architecture.html). We'll then finally put everything together, designing the whole hardware architecture of the computer containing, memory, instruction memory, and the CPU.
7. [Assembler](https://www.quentinwach.com/Hack-Computer/6_Assembler.html). Finally, we'll create an Assembler and write some Assembly for this computer concluding in an implementation of the game _Pong_.
8. [Conclusion](https://www.quentinwach.com/Hack-Computer/7_Conclusion.html). Some concluding thoughts, ideas for the future, tips, and useful references.
