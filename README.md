# The Hack Computer Architecture
_"Hack is a general-purpose computer system, designed to strike a balance between simplicity and power. On the one hand, the Hack architecture can be built in just a few hours of work, [...] at the same time, Hack is sufficiently general to illustrate the key operating principles and hardware elements underlying the design of any digital computer."_ 

This projects is based on the book [_Elements of Computing Systems_](https://www.nand2tetris.org/book). It can be helpful to hence also look into the related [NAND to Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course). But I decided to **not use the provided tools** but instead teach myself the more **common tools in the industry** like [Verilog]().
