## Future Ideas
<!--
Since there are so many other people who have already done quite similar projects, I do not plan to continue much further here. Still, general topics for future work may include:
### Software
+ Virtual Machine
+ High-Level Language
+ Compiler
+ Operating System
+ Running Doom?
+ Hardware emulator.
+ Compiler to code and run games on it in C or Python?
### Hardware
+ .gds Layout
+ TinyTapeout
+ FPGA tests
+ High resolution graphics to emulate a really cool retro game
  + Flappy Bird!
  + Fluid Simulation?
+ Assemble the computer on breadboards or PCB (provide files).
